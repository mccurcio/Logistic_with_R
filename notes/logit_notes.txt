Understanding Logit


Book: Applied Logistic Regression by David Hosmer & Stanley Lemeshow, 2000, isbn: 0-471-35632-8


1. commonly used for discrete output, binary or dichotomous

What is the goal of Logit

* Linear and logit have same assumptions

- The Observations are Independent
- There is No Multicollinearity Among Explanatory Variables
- There are No Extreme Outliers
- There is a Linear Relationship Between Explanatory Variables and the Logit of the Response Variable
- The Sample Size is Sufficiently Large

### Assumptions of Logistic Regression vs. Linear Regression

* In contrast to linear regression, logistic regression does not require:

1. A linear relationship between the explanatory variable(s) and the response variable.
1. The residuals of the model to be normally distributed.
1. The residuals to have constant variance, also known as homoscedasticity.


Logistic Regression Real Life Example

    The transaction is fraudulent.
    The transaction is not fraudulent.

- The second advantage is speed, and sometimes this is crucial.
- logit is very explainable


There are three types of logistic regression models:

    Binary logistic regression: The response variable can only belong to one of two categories.
    Multinomial logistic regression: The response variable can belong to one of three or more categories and there is no natural ordering among the categories.
    Ordinal logistic regression: The response variable can belong to one of three or more categories and there is a natural ordering among the categories.
